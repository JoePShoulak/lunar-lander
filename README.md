# lunar-lander
Little game I'm working on. 

Check it out [here](https://joepshoulak.github.io/lunar-lander/)!

## Controls
Space: Toggles Engine  
Up Arrow: Increases throttle by 1%  
Down Arrow: Decreases throttle by 1%  
Left Arrow: Rotates ship counterclockwise  
Right Arrow: Rotates ship counterclockwise  

I haven't built a good UI for the information to be displayed on screen, but if you hit F12 you can view the console tab of the dev console to see every command being sent to your ship.
